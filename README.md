# Simple Course Stats for Learn.Cantrill.io üìä

## üéØ Purpose

This nifty JavaScript tool üõ†Ô∏è enhances the learning experience on [learn.cantrill.io](https://learn.cantrill.io) by using HTML DOM manipulation to provide a detailed breakdown üìà of each course section directly on the webpage. It dynamically calculates and displays:

- **üìö Total Lessons:** Counts the total number of lessons in each section.
- **‚è±Ô∏è Total Duration:** Aggregates the total duration of all video lessons in the section.
- **üèÅ Remaining Duration:** Estimates the time required to complete the remaining lessons based on the ones you've yet to finish.

The information is displayed under the section titles, accessible via a dropdown button for a clutter-free interface. 

## üßê Why This Script?

While the site shows overall progress, this script provides detailed insights that help in planning üöÄ. Knowing the exact number of lessons and their durations makes it easier to set achievable targets üéØ, like finishing a certain number of lessons daily or completing a section within a week.
